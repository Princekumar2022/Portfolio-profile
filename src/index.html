                <h3>Project 1 Blogging-sites</h3>
                <p>It's basically a short version of a blog that allows you to share small elements of content, such as
                    single sentences, images, GIFs, infographics, videos, links, and audio clips with your audiences.
                    Think short, quick, frequent blog posts typically posted on nontraditional and traditional blogging
                    platforms.</p>

                <h3>Project 4 Short Url</h3>
                <p>URL shorteners are everywhere, from links you share on twitter to popular services like bit.ly. But
                    have you ever wondered how you could create a quick URL shortener for yourself?

                    So we'll go through the hands-on practice of building a URL shortener with MongoDB as our backend
                    solution. This project will give you confidence in your knowledge and solidify each concept you
                    learn.</p>
